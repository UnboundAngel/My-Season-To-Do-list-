# Project Nexus (To-Do)

A seasonal, collectible-inspired to-do list implemented in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface leans on a professional dark base with opt-in holiday overlays and a Pokémon-style card deck for reviewing tasks.

## Quick start

```bash
# clone the repository
 git clone https://github.com/UnboundAngel/My-Season-To-Do-list-.git
 cd My-Season-To-Do-list-

# open the index.html file in your preferred browser
```

All logic runs client-side—no build step or package manager required.

## Features

- Spacious, two-column layout with keyboard shortcuts for search (`/`) and quick add (`n`).
- Filters for all, pending, completed, today, and upcoming tasks with due-date sorting.
- Pokémon-inspired card deck overlay with book-like flips via click, `Space`, or arrow keys.
- Seasonal themes: Professional Dark, Halloween (with a pumpkin path), Christmas (snow field with Santa), and Mocking Neon.
- Local storage persistence for tasks and theme preferences.

## Holiday art

Updated icons live in [`assets/icons`](assets/icons) and can be swapped as favicons or used for social previews.

## Documentation

Additional notes, update history, and structure references live in the [`docs/`](docs) folder.
